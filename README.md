Resource Management Simulator

Program Description
oss.c simulates a primitive operating system that spawns processes (user.c) and logs resource requests, releases, and deadlocks at various times to a file using a simulated clock. Deadlocks are resolved in order from the lowest deadlocked process index to the highest. Upon normal program termination, a list of statistics is displayed.

Options
-h Help option: displays options and their usage for oss.c.
Usage: ./oss -h
-v Verbose option: this option affects what information is saved in the log file.
Usage: ./oss -v

Original Specification Sheet
Resource Management
In this part of the assignment, you will design and implement a resource management module for our Operating System
Simulator oss. In this project, you will use the deadlock detection and recovery strategy to manage resources.
There is no scheduling in this project, but you will be using shared memory so be cognizant of possible race conditions.

Operating System Simulator
This will be your main program and serve as the master process. You will start the operating system simulator (call the
executable oss) as one main process who will fork multiple children at random times. The randomness will be simulated
by a logical clock that will be updated by oss as well as user processes. The logical clock resides in shared memory and is
accessed as a critical resource using a semaphore. You should have two unsigned integers for the clock; one will show the time
in seconds and the other will show the time in nanoseconds, offset from the beginning of a second.
In the beginning, oss will allocate shared memory for system data structures, including resource descriptors for each resource.
All the resources are static but some of them may be shared. The resource descriptor is a fixed size structure and contains
information on managing the resources within oss. Make sure that you allocate space to keep track of activities that affect
the resources, such as request, allocation, and release. The resource descriptors will reside in shared memory and will be
accessible to the child. Create descriptors for 20 resources, out of which about 20% should be sharable resources (about implies that it should be 20 Â± 5% and you should generate that number with a random number generator).
After creating the descriptors, make sure that they are populated with an initial number of resources; assign a number between 1 and
10 (inclusive) for the initial instances in each resource class. You may have to initialize another structure in the descriptor to
indicate the allocation of specific instances of a resource to a process.
After the resources have been set up, fork a user process at random times (between 1 and 500 milliseconds of your logical
clock). Make sure that you never have more than 18 user processes in the system. If you already have 18 processes, do not
create any more until some process terminates. Your user processes execute concurrently and there is no scheduling performed.
They run in a loop constantly till they have to terminate.
oss should grant resources when asked as long as it can find sufficient resources to allocate. Periodically oss should run a
deadlock detection algorithm. If there are some deadlocked processes, it will kill them one by one till the deadlock is resolved.
If you use some policy to kill processes, put that in your README file as well as in the code documentation. Make sure to
release any resources claimed by a process when it is terminated.
Your system should run for a maximum of 2 real life seconds, but the amount of simulated seconds maximum is up to you as
long as processes are deadlocking and your system is recovering from that deadlock and continuing on at least 5 times total.

User Processes
While the user processes are not actually doing anything, they will be asking for resources at random times.
You should have a parameter giving a bound for when a process should request/let go of a resource. Each process when it starts
should roll a random number from 0 to that bound and when it occurs it should try and either claim a new resource or release
a resource that it already has. It should make this request by putting a request in shared memory. It will continue looping and
checking to see if it is granted that resource.
At random times (between 0 and 250ms), the process checks if it should terminate successfully. If so, it should deallocate all
the resources allocated to it by communicating to master that it is releasing all those resources. Make sure that this probability
to terminate is low enough that churn happens in your system.
I want you to keep track of statistics during your runs. Keep track of how many requests have been granted, as well as number
of processes were terminated by the deadlock detection algorithm vs processes that eventually terminated successfully. How
many times the deadlock detection was run, how many processes it had to terminate and percentage of total processes in a
deadlock it had to kill on average.
Make sure that you have signal handling to terminate all processes, if needed. In case of abnormal termination, make sure to
remove shared memory and semaphores.
When writing to the log file, you should have two ways of doing this. One setting (verbose on) should indicate in the log file
every time master gives someone a requested resource or when master sees that a user has finished with a resource. It should
also log the time when a deadlock is detected and how it removed the deadlock. That is, which processes were terminated. In
addition, every 20 granted requests, output a table showing the current resources allocated to each process.

An example of possible output might be:
Master has detected Process P0 requesting R2 at time xxx:xxx
Master granting P0 request R2 at time xxx:xxx
Master has acknowledged Process P0 releasing R2 at time xxx: xxx
Current system resources
Master running deadlock detection at time xxx:xxxx:
Processes P3, P4, P7 deadlocked
Attempting to resolve deadlock...
Killing process P3:
Resources released are as follows: R1:1, R3:1, R4:5
Master running deadlock detection after P3 killed
Processes P4, P7 deadlocked
Killing process P4:
Resources released are as follows: R1:3, R3:1, R4:2
System is no longer in deadlock
Master has detected Process P7 requesting R3 at time xxx:xxxx
...
R0 R1 R2 R3 ...
P0 2 1 3 4 ...
P1 0 1 1 0 ...
P2 3 1 0 0 ...
P3 7 0 1 1 ...
P4 0 0 3 2 ...
P7 1 2 0 5 ...
...

When verbose is off, it should only log when a deadlock is detected and how it was resolved.
Regardless of which option is set, keep track of how many times master has written to the file. If you have done 100000 lines
of output to the file, stop writing any output until you have finished the run.
Note: I give you broad leeway on this project to handle notifications to master and how you resolve the deadlock. Just make
sure that you document what you are doing in your README.
